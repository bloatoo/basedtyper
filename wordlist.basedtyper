soydev
The Silicon Valley/ Seattle based [soy latte] drinking hipster you see at the coffee shop, coding [NodeJS] on his macbook pro. He only uses a bloated IDE and is too beta to ever touch [Vim]. This creature will justify his use of a macbook by saying that "it's UNIX based" but at the same time will defend not having a linux machine due to some nonsense reason. GUI everything; it makes him feel safe. #1 aspiration in life is to work for [FAANG] and will consume any disgusting product or service they sell.

freetard
one who firmly believes in not paying for e.g. software, films, music.  Generally an avid [proponent] of [p2p] [filesharing]
